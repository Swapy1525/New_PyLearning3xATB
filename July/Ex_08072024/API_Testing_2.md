## Web Service

API -
Application programming interface
any interface that allows one piece of software to interact with other.

whenever API traditionally works with HTTP we call them web services
[API operates over the web, typically using HTTP protocol]
(API's are online)- WebServices


eg. when we search for any flight, it is connecting to multiple API's.  
[it will not be a webservice if it is not online]


All the web services are API but not all the API are not web services

## web services types
- REST (f)  -----> 75%
- SOAP (f)  -----> 7%
- XML -RPC/JSON  ----> <1%

## How companies are testing API

- Same way as manual testing
  - requirements
  - test plan
  - test cases
  - test execution-- tools like postman, rest assured, request module
  - API automation
  

- Requirements (good company---> will give documents)
-              ---> otherwise we need to prepare doc
url
payload
http methods
status
what to verify
Request header
body
Auth
cookie
token



API testing ----> manually 
           ----> Automation (with tools)
