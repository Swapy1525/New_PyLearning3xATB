# Error vs Exception

try:
    while True print("hello")   #syntax error
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

#error cant be handled by exceptions
#erros are difficult to recover
#prevent the program from running
#impossible -> syntax, indentation


# Exceptions can be handled
#program recovery is possible
